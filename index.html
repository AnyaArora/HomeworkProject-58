            <p>     I love to read. When I read I learn new words. I also love diving into fantasy world. When I leave I know it is still there waiting for me. I read books about monsters and battles. I don't like non-fiction books about real people. I like books with action. Anyway, my teacher says I'm a good writier.(I don't belive him) He also says its because of all the books I read. Maybe it is. I like reading books, and when I read I take the author of the books writing stlyes and make my own. I really love reading. Maybe you should go get a book to read too. (I got part of the paraghraph from books.)

            <h2> My favorite books
            </h2>
            <h3>    Hello! I'm back. I hope you didn't miss me to much! (got part of that from a book) Anyway, one of my favorite book seiers it "The Keeper of the Lost Cites" seires by Shannon Messenger. (I'm really sorry if I spelled you name wrong) Another one of my favorites is "Percy Jackson" by Rick Riordan (Once again sorry bout the names. ) So, those are my top two but I love all the books I read. That's because if I don't like a book I stop reading it. Okay, see you later.
